## STrace alternative using eBPF
Essentailly using eBPF to trace syscalls in linux, and hopefully in macos in the future when eBPFs are supported in OSX.

*TechStack*: CPP, eBPF

*Resources*:
- [Tracing Syscalls](https://falco.org/blog/tracing-syscalls-using-ebpf-part-1/#:~:text=eBPF%20provides%20powerful%20tracing%20and,visibility%20into%20the%20system%20behaviour.)
- [A blog going through something similar](https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/blog/2019-01-31-full-system-dynamic-tracing-on-linux-using-ebpf-and-bpftrace.html)

## Comp Geom Library (In rust :astonished:?)
A computational Geometry library to abstract out the maths behind computational Geometry.

*TechStack*: Rust?

*Resources*: 
- [CGAL Algos](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/packages.html#PartAlgebraicFoundations)
- [Geometry Central](https://geometry-central.net/)

## Photo Editing App
A photo editing app with the abillity to use custom shaders and differnet convolution methods.

*TechStack*: Tkinter, Python

*Resources*:
- [Tkinter Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- [Image Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))

## Implement Nanite
Implement a nanite like rendering pipeline to have virtualized geometry. Also maybe try to use [mesh shader](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-turing-mesh-shaders/)

*TechStack*: CPP

*Resources*:
- [Nanite Siggraph Talk](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2021/Karis_Nanite_SIGGRAPH_Advances_2021_final.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiR85Shh4T9AhVy7jgGHeSMBzsQFnoECA4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1t9osHg7pHvsZLp79GjKCi)

## Video Player
Make a video decoder and have a video playback on web using grpc.

*TechStack*: JS? Rust?

*Resources*: 
- [grpc video streamer written in python](https://github.com/Nirvan101/GRPC-Video-streaming)

## ML
Implement Deep learning models in C. A simple neural network with gradient decent and back propogation. Use dual numbers to find derivative.

*TechStack*: C

*Resources*:
- [Dual Numebers and auto differentiation](https://blog.demofox.org/2014/12/30/dual-numbers-automatic-differentiation/)
- [Neural networks from scratch](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65)

## Marching Cubes
Render Marching cubes using 4d perlin noise with one dimension as time.

*TechStack*: CPP, maybe unity if rendering is too hard :p

*Resources*: 
- [Marching Cubes](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/MarchingCubes.html)

## Unity Shaders
Write cool unity shaders. like these: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/

Maybe complete the hyperbolic rendererðŸ˜²?
